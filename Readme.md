Building Tools
==============

This is a collection of tools to process NPS Building data.
The data consists of Spatial data in the eGIS Building Data Model,
Photos (organized by Park), a Photo list, and an extract from the
Facility Management System (FMSS).

These simplistic python tools were written to run from the folders
with the data (not included), and currently assume the data is in
a file geodatabase (spatial data and FMSS extract), CSV (photo list),
and JPEGs in Park Folders.

The spatial data and photo list have been moved to SQL Server.
However these tools have not yet been upgraded.
